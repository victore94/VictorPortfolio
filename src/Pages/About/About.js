                Full Stack Web Developer leveraging a background in sociology to build a more intuitive user experience on the web. I recently earned a certificate in Full Stack Development from the University of California, Davis, developing skills in  MongoDB, Express.js, ReactJS, and Node.js. While working with a team of two designers and two fellow developers, I’ve been able to successfully create multiple MERN applications including one that allows users to bet on e-sporting events. Excited to develop responsive websites; as well as applications, and collaborate with a team in a meaningful way. I’m positioned well to provide a unique and impactful perspective on development from start to full deployment.
